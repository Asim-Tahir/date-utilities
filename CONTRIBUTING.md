Example Pull Request Title:

```

```

##### Pull Request Description

Example Pull Request Description:

```
This PR fixes #3063

When given a negative amount on `Ã ddMethods` its will subtract the amount from the current date.
And when given a negative amount on `subtractMethods` its will add the amount to the current date.
```

##### Commit Message

We recommend that you use a commit message that is short(max 50 character for commit message, 70 character for the body, footer etc.) and descriptive. The commit message should be a single sentence, and should be clear and concise. Body of the commit message should be a detailed description of the change. We follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines. And our **scopes/categories** are:

- `manipulate`: Manipulate date methods
- `comparison`: Comparison date methods
- `working-days`: Working days related methods

Example commit messages:

###### Commit message with description and breaking change footer

```
feat(manipulate): add `addMiliseconds` and `addMinutes` methods

BREAKING CHANGE: `addSeconds` method is now deprecated. Use `addMilliseconds` instead.
```

###### Commit message with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers

```
fix(working-days): overlapping working days in chain

While `addWorkingDays` and `subtractWorkingDays' methods are chained,
the adding/subtracing days are overlapping.

This caused by the context of the chain. For example, if you add
5 working days to a date, and then subtract another 5 working days,
the date will be subtracted 5 working days more than you expected.

To avoid this problem, clean the context after each call
of the methods.
